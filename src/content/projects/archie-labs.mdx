# Senior Software Developer at Archie Labs

During my time at Archie Labs, I worked on cutting-edge AI-powered platforms that generated and deployed web applications autonomously using AI agents and modern full-stack technologies.

## Experience Overview

- **Company**: Archie Labs
- **Role**: Senior Software Developer
- **Timeline**: September 2024 - July 2025 (11 months)
- **Tech Stack**: TypeScript, Python, React, Next.js, AI Agents, PostgreSQL

## About the Role

As a Senior Software Developer, I focused on building and maintaining AI-driven web applications. My responsibilities spanned both front-end and back-end development, bridging the gap between AI technology and practical user-facing applications.

## Key Responsibilities

### AI Integration
- Implemented AI generation processes, integrating agents, models, and AI algorithms into web applications
- Ensured efficient and scalable AI features that could handle complex user requirements
- Worked with multiple AI models to optimize for speed, cost, and quality

### Front-End Development
- Designed intuitive, responsive user interfaces with focus on performance and accessibility
- Created real-time feedback systems to show AI generation progress
- Built conversational interfaces that allowed users to iterate on generated applications

### Back-End Development
- Developed robust APIs and services to support AI features using Node.js and Python-based frameworks
- Implemented efficient job queuing and processing systems for long-running AI tasks
- Created checkpoint systems for error recovery and generation resumption

### Data Handling & Processing
- Managed and processed large datasets to drive AI functionalities
- Ensured data security, optimization, and compliance with best practices
- Implemented caching strategies to improve performance and reduce costs

### Collaboration
- Worked closely with data scientists and AI engineers to integrate complex algorithms into user-friendly applications
- Participated in code reviews and technical discussions to maintain high code quality
- Contributed to architectural decisions and technical planning

### Continuous Improvement
- Kept up with the latest trends in AI, machine learning, and software development
- Enhanced application performance and scalability through iterative improvements
- Implemented automated testing and quality checks for generated code

## Key Challenges & Solutions

### Code Quality Consistency
One of the biggest challenges was ensuring generated code maintained consistent quality and style. I addressed this by creating component templates and implementing automated validation steps.

### Managing Long Generation Times
Complex applications took several minutes to generate, risking user drop-off. I solved this by implementing detailed progress updates and streaming partial results, improving completion rates from 45% to 78%.

### Error Recovery
Generation failures could leave applications in incomplete states. I built a checkpoint system that allowed users to resume failed generations, significantly improving reliability.

## Skills Developed

**Technical Skills**:
- Advanced TypeScript and Python development
- AI/LLM integration (Anthropic Claude API)
- Real-time communication (Server-Sent Events)
- Complex state management
- Error handling and recovery patterns

**Soft Skills**:
- Problem-solving in ambiguous situations
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Technical communication
- Product thinking and user empathy

This role allowed me to blend AI innovation with full-stack development, creating solutions that drove business outcomes and improved user experiences.
