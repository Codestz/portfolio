# Full Stack Developer at Kualty

At Kualty, I worked on **Thr1ft**, a unique second-hand marketplace platform with a mission-based shopping experience. The product consisted of three interconnected systems: a mobile application for customers, a PWA for store owners and administrators, and a Shopify integration.

## Experience Overview

- **Company**: Kualty
- **Role**: Full Stack Developer
- **Timeline**: October 2022 - December 2023 (1 year 3 months)
- **Location**: Colombia
- **Product**: Thr1ft (Mission-based second-hand marketplace)
- **Tech Stack**: React, React Native, TypeScript, Shopify API, Node.js, PostgreSQL

## About the Product - Thr1ft

Thr1ft was a second-hand marketplace with a unique twist: **mission-based shopping**. Unlike traditional e-commerce, the platform operated on a time-based system where shopping missions started on specific days (typically weekends), and the app was only open during these mission windows.

### The Three-Part System

**1. Mobile Application (React Native)**

- Customer-facing app for purchasing second-hand products
- **One stock per product** - First user to purchase wins
- **Mission-based access** - App only opens during active missions
- Real-time inventory updates to show product availability
- Fast checkout process optimized for competition-style shopping

**2. Progressive Web App (PWA)**

- Admin and store owner dashboard
- Product management and inventory control
- Mission scheduling and control panel
- Customer management and support tools
- Order review and fulfillment tracking
- Analytics and reporting

**3. Shopify Integration**

- Connected Shopify stores to Thr1ft platform
- Automated product sync from Shopify → PWA → Mobile app
- Order management across platforms
- Inventory synchronization
- Unified dashboard for Shopify merchants

## Key Responsibilities

### Mobile App Development

- Built React Native application for iOS and Android
- Implemented **real-time product availability** system (critical for one-stock items)
- Created **mission timer** UI showing when next mission starts
- Developed **fast checkout flow** to handle high-demand purchasing
- Optimized for speed - milliseconds mattered when competing for products
- Implemented push notifications for mission starts and product alerts

### PWA Admin Panel

- Developed responsive admin dashboard using React
- Built **mission control system** for scheduling and managing shopping windows
- Created product management interface with bulk upload capabilities
- Implemented order management and customer support tools
- Built analytics dashboard for tracking mission performance
- Designed role-based access control for different admin levels

### Shopify Integration

- Integrated Shopify API for product synchronization
- Built middleware to transform Shopify products for Thr1ft format
- Implemented webhook handlers for real-time inventory updates
- Created OAuth flow for merchant onboarding
- Developed sync engine to handle product updates and conflicts
- Built admin interface for managing connected Shopify stores

### Mission-Based System

- Designed and implemented time-gated access system
- Built scheduling engine for mission start/end times
- Created countdown timers and real-time status updates
- Implemented queue system for high-traffic mission starts
- Optimized database queries for concurrent user access during missions

## Key Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Race Conditions on Single-Stock Items

**Problem**: Multiple users attempting to purchase the same item simultaneously (only 1 stock available).

**Solution**:

- Implemented optimistic locking at database level
- Added transaction handling with rollback on conflicts
- Created real-time inventory updates via WebSockets
- Built UI feedback for "item no longer available" scenarios
- Implemented cart expiration (15-second hold) to prevent abandoned carts blocking inventory

### Challenge 2: High Traffic During Mission Starts

**Problem**: Hundreds of users accessing the app simultaneously when missions opened, causing server strain.

**Solution**:

- Implemented queue system for mission entry
- Used Redis for session management and caching
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- Added CDN for static assets
- Implemented progressive loading for product lists
- Created load testing scenarios to prepare for peak traffic

### Challenge 3: Shopify Sync Reliability

**Problem**: Ensuring Shopify inventory stayed in sync with Thr1ft without conflicts or delays.

**Solution**:

- Built webhook retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Implemented conflict resolution rules (Shopify as source of truth)
- Created sync status dashboard for merchants
- Added manual sync trigger for troubleshooting
- Logged all sync operations for debugging

### Challenge 4: Time Zone Management

**Problem**: Missions needed to start at correct local times for different regions.

**Solution**:

- Stored all times in UTC, converted on client
- Added timezone configuration per mission
- Built preview system to verify mission times
- Created automated tests for timezone edge cases

## Skills Developed

**Technical Skills**:

- React Native mobile development
- Progressive Web App architecture
- Shopify API integration and OAuth
- Real-time systems with WebSockets
- Race condition handling and optimistic locking
- High-traffic system optimization

**E-commerce Domain**:

- Inventory management systems
- Payment processing and checkout flows
- Mission/time-based product releases
- Multi-tenant architecture (Shopify merchants)

**Soft Skills**:

- Working under time pressure (fast-paced product launches)
- Cross-functional collaboration with product and design teams
- Problem-solving for unique business models
- Debugging production issues in real-time during missions

## Impact & Results

### Performance Metrics

- **Mobile App**: Smooth performance during high-traffic missions (500+ concurrent users)
- **PWA**: Fast admin operations with sub-second response times
- **Shopify Sync**: 99.8% sync success rate with automatic retry on failures

### User Experience Wins

- **Fast checkout**: Average purchase time under 10 seconds
- **Real-time updates**: Inventory changes reflected instantly
- **Mission reliability**: Missions started on time with queue system handling traffic spikes
- **Cross-platform sync**: Shopify → Thr1ft sync completed within 2 minutes

## Technical Highlights

**Architecture**:

- Monorepo structure with shared TypeScript types
- REST API with WebSocket support for real-time features
- PostgreSQL with optimistic locking for inventory
- Redis for caching and session management
- Queue system (Bull) for background jobs

**Mission System**:

- Cron-based scheduler for mission activation
- State machine for mission lifecycle (upcoming → active → ended)
- Real-time countdown synchronized across all clients
- Grace period handling for late checkouts

**Shopify Integration**:

- OAuth 2.0 for merchant authentication
- Webhook subscriptions for real-time updates
- Bulk import API for initial product sync
- Rate limiting compliance with Shopify API

This role taught me how to build systems that handle time-critical operations, manage race conditions in high-traffic scenarios, and integrate with third-party platforms like Shopify.

**Key Takeaway**: Working on Thr1ft taught me how to build time-gated, high-competition e-commerce systems where performance and reliability are critical to the user experience.
