# Full Stack Developer at 8base

At 8base, I contributed to the development of AI-powered products, working across the full stack with a strong focus on front-end logic while ensuring seamless integration of business logic and backend functionalities using microservices architecture.

## Experience Overview

- **Company**: 8base
- **Role**: Full Stack Developer
- **Timeline**: December 2023 - July 2025 (1 year 8 months)
- **Tech Stack**: React, Node.js, GraphQL, Microservices, AI/ML, Kubernetes

## About the Role

I played a key role in building scalable, AI-powered products by connecting AI-driven components to user interfaces and occasionally developing backend services. The work involved bridging the gap between AI technology, microservices, and the user interface.

## Key Responsibilities

### Front-End Development

- Built and optimized responsive, user-friendly interfaces that interacted with AI models and APIs
- Ensured seamless user experiences when working with AI-driven features
- Implemented real-time data processing and dynamic UI updates
- Focused on performance optimization for AI-heavy interfaces

### Logic Integration

- Connected AI algorithms and machine learning models to the front-end
- Enabled real-time data processing and dynamic content updates
- Implemented state management for complex AI workflows
- Created abstractions to simplify AI integration for other developers

### Back-End Development

- Developed and integrated APIs and services using microservices architecture
- Implemented backend logic for AI features
- Ensured proper communication between front-end and microservices
- Worked with GraphQL to create efficient data fetching patterns

### AI & Microservices

- Integrated AI-powered microservices to ensure efficient, scalable features
- Worked within a distributed architecture to enable modular, maintainable development
- Implemented event-driven patterns for service communication
- Contributed to service design and API contracts

### Collaboration

- Partnered with AI engineers, backend developers, and cross-functional teams
- Ensured AI features were integrated seamlessly across the stack
- Participated in architectural discussions and technical planning
- Mentored junior developers on best practices

### Business Logic Implementation

- Translated business requirements into functional logic across front-end and backend
- Ensured features aligned with business goals and user needs
- Balanced technical constraints with product requirements

### UI/UX Refinement

- Collaborated with design teams to ensure products were visually appealing and user-friendly
- Effectively leveraged AI capabilities while maintaining intuitive interfaces
- Conducted user testing and iterated based on feedback

## Key Challenges & Solutions

### Distributed System Complexity

Working with microservices introduced challenges around data consistency, service discovery, and error handling. I learned to embrace eventual consistency and implement robust error recovery patterns.

### AI Integration Performance

AI features often introduced latency. I addressed this through aggressive caching, optimistic UI updates, and selecting appropriate AI models based on speed-quality tradeoffs.

### Cross-Service Communication

Ensuring reliable communication between services required careful API design, comprehensive error handling, and monitoring. I helped establish patterns that the team could follow consistently.

### Balancing Autonomy and Alignment

With multiple services and teams, maintaining alignment while preserving autonomy was crucial. Regular sync meetings, clear API contracts, and documentation helped keep everyone aligned.
